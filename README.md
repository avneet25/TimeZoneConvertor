# Project description
As international students, there is a frequent need to convert Canadian time to Indian time. So, this app was created for ET & IST date-time conversions. 
Decided to keep the project simple, focusing on core needs. To address 'current time' becoming â€˜stale', refresh button is provided to get latest time (over automatic update). 


# Conversion Logic
Kotlin has built-in support for handling time zones and conversions using the Java Time API (java.time).
